# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy Steps

### Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "Add New Project"
4. Import your `luuk` repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect the settings
6. Click "Deploy"
7. Your site will be live in seconds!

### Option 2: Via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally (one time only)
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from your project directory
cd c:\Users\ace21\.vscode\projects\luuk
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Yes
# - Which scope? Your account
# - Link to existing project? No
# - Project name? luuk (or your choice)
# - Directory? ./ (just press Enter)
# - Override settings? No

# For production deployment:
vercel --prod
```

## What's Configured

- âœ… All files committed to GitHub
- âœ… `vercel.json` configured for static site
- âœ… `.gitignore` set up properly
- âœ… README.md created
- âœ… Media paths corrected to `public/assets/`
- âœ… Dummy comments removed
- âœ… Clean, production-ready code

## Your Repository

- **GitHub URL**: https://github.com/ACE-codes21/luuk
- **Branch**: main

## After Deployment

Your site will get a URL like:
- `https://luuk.vercel.app` (if available)
- `https://luuk-username.vercel.app`
- Or a custom domain if you set one up

## Troubleshooting

If media doesn't load:
- Vercel serves files from root and respects folder structure
- Make sure `public/` folder is in your repo
- Check that media files are committed (they should be)

## Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to your project in Vercel
2. Settings â†’ Domains
3. Add your custom domain
4. Follow DNS instructions
